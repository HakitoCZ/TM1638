# TM1638

Personal arduino project for controlling a little TM1638 board. 

The code is likely to be ugly, badly in need for optimisation and/or
buggy as hell. It's done for entertainment purposes only. 

The board
---------
- Two four-digit seven-segment displays
- Eight leds
- Eight buttons - there is also a version with sixteen buttons
- Three control lines - STB, CLK, DIO
- VCC and GND
- The main IC is TM1638 and all the datasheets I found were auto-
translated, so brace yourself if you want to use that.
